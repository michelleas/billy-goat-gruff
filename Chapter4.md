Billy the Goat ventures outdoors.

After successfully learning the alphabet, how to count, and how to speak English, Billy the Goat decided it was time to venture outside.
He wanted to practice the new skills he learned, so he took a walk around the block.
Billy the Goat saw some bushes and realized he was hungry.
As he started eating the bushes, he counted them.
One, two, three, four bushes.
Yummmm, thought Billy.
Then Billy wondered, how did he know what he ate was a bush?
And then he started questioning his entire existence and curled up into a ball on the ground.
He rocked back and forth, surrounded by all the multitudes of the universe, feeling very small.
Then he realized he was hungry again and went back inside to eat.
